## Introduction 

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world. 

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city.

Capital Bikeshare is a company in Washington, DC which provides local residents, workers, and tourists a method of public transportation. The system operates 591 bike docks and 4,500 bikes across the Washington, DC metro area where users can start and end their commute. The purpose of this project is to do some exploratory data analysis of the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington DC, time series prediction and finally deploy machine learning model on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) by using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).



## Domain Analysis:

With urbanization, the demand for daily commuting is also growing. People need an efficient transportation mode to travel from their homes to an intermediate point, such as a bus stop or metro station, and then from that intermediate point to work, college or any other destination.

Additionally, a large number of people also travel directly between their home and destination, without using intermediary modes of transport. Hiring a cab or using other public transit services can be slightly expensive and not always reliable, in terms of efficiency, which is why the demand for micromobility services, including bike (bicycle) sharing, is rising.

Dock-less and station-based are the two types of bike sharing services available across the world, of which dock-less services were more popular in 2017-2018. This is because dock-less bikes can be picked up and dropped off anywhere, as per the convenience of riders, which makes them more popular.

Among the two types of bikes available for sharing purposes - pedal and electric - e-bikes are rapidly gaining popularity. The major reason behind it is that such vehicles are capable of higher speeds, compared to manually operated bikes.

Bikesharing has become increasingly popular in North America and Europe.The bike sharing market growth in Europe is predicted to be the fastest across the globe, as a large number of service providers would venture into the region in the coming years. In regional countries, bikes are being rapidly made available near major transit hubs, such as railway stations, thereby offering users convenience and ease of travel. Additionally, the European Union (EU) also promotes such services, as they are environment-friendly and help reduce traffic.

Therefore, with an increasing number of people demanding cost-effective daily commuting options, the popularity of bike sharing services would continue increasing.


## Data Description:

All the data used in this project are included in the respective folders. The data was collected from the capital bike share [website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html) where they publish their bike ride data. There are data from two different timeframe 2011-12, and 2018-19-20. Al the used data included in this project were in .json format and transformed into .csv format for further analysis.





## Exploratory Analysis:

In the segmant of exploratory analysis, from the company [website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html) I analyzed the data of 2011-12 using barplots, boxplots, pairplots, lineplots and scatterplots. While doing this analyze I used several metrics such as, average number of bike rentals in day/hour, average rental duration, average distance and average speed. Member type, season, month, weekday and weather these are the main dimensions used in analysis. 

The achieved results were the following:

 1) Users with Registered Member generate majority of rides - around 3 times more than Casual members.
 2) Member users rent more bikes than Casual users.
 3) By observing number of bike rentals on each weekday, we can conclude that Member users tend to ride a bike from Monday to Friday (probably to work, university, school), while Casual users are most active during weekends (bike trips). Duration of ride doesn't depend on weekday for Member users and for Casual riders it's slightly longer during the weekend.
 4) For Member users there are two peaks during the day when number of bike rentals is the highest: in the morning (around 7-9am) and in the afternoon (around 4-6pm). It is in line with the hypothesis that those users rent a bike to get to / back from work or school. For Casual users there's no clear peak, however between 11am - 5pm the activity is the highest.
 5) The pattern of number of bike rentals in an hour doesn't change throughout the seasons - only the level of number of rentals is the lowest in the winter and the highest in the summer. Summer has the highest hourly average of bike rentals and it also characterized with the biggest variance of number of hourly bike rentals. At the same time, winter has the lowest average number of hourly bike rentals and also standard deviation is the lowest.


## Facebook Prophet:

 Facebookâ€™s Prophet library is designed to do Time Series forecasting and supports R and Python. In this stage, The full 2018-20 data from the company [website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html) were used to give a forecast using Facebook Prophet. We used this library-
1) to predict What the future bike sharing demand will look like for the next 3 months.
2) to investigate Factors that contribute to demand.
3) to find out the hidden opportunities for increasing demand.






## Flask App: 

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. In this stage, we made an app with Flask to get a prediction of rented bikes per hour by using [AdaBoostRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor.html) as regression. It takes an input of weekday, hour, month, member type and  is a holiday or not, and gives a prediction of bike usage within the hour. The app can be found on https://bike-share-count.herokuapp.com .
